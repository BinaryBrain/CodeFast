Code Fast
=========

Whenever you code fast, you cannot really feel how fast you are.  
CodeFast.js solves this giant problem by controling the speed of your fan so you can imagine you are running against the wind.

Runs on Linux (maybe Mac OS X).

Install
=======

```
npm install
```

Run
===

```
sudo node codefast.js
```

Note that you have to be a sudoer because it contains a local keylogger.
